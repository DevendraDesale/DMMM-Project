This is the KE DMMM project directory.

The final output generated is in the file named: "DMMM_Project_Final"
Both Rmd and pdf are available. There might be some of the packages which you need to install
Before going ahead with the execution.


The Boxplot and Histograms of all the variables are available in the respective files.

The practice files and code is also made available, but there is no perticular order in which we executed it.
There might be some cases when we generated data in other file and used in other.
These files are purely for the referance.

The code snippet found in some of the files might be found online, as we learnt from. We have tried to be as
original and honest as possible, have learnt great things doing this project. 

Thanks..
